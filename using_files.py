from helper_functions import get_llm_response
from IPython.display import display, Markdown


# * Write a prompt to create a recipe using `get_llm_response`.

# In[2]:


# Write a list of ingredients
ingredients = ['chicken', 'broccoli', 'rice']

# Write the prompt
prompt = f"""
    Create a short recipe that uses the following ingredients:
    {ingredients}
"""

# Get the response from the LLM
response = get_llm_response(prompt)

# Print the LLM response
print(response)


# ## Opening a text file and saving it as a string

# You will load data that has already been created and is stored üìÅ for you in files.
# 
# * Start by loading an email that Daniel sent recently. It is stored in a '.txt' file.

# In[3]:


f = open("email.txt","r")
email = f.read()
f.close()


# * Print what it is 'inside' the email ‚úâÔ∏è.

# In[4]:


print(email)


# <p style="background-color:#F5C780; padding:15px"> ü§ñ <b>Use the Chatbot</b>:
#     <br><br>
#     Explain this code line by line:
#     <br><br>f = open("email.txt", "r")
#     <br>email = f.read()
#     <br>f.close()
# </p>

# <p style="background-color:#F5C780; padding:15px"> ü§ñ <b>Use the Chatbot</b>:
#     <br><br>
#     What happens if I don't close a file?
# </p>

# ## Using LLMs to extract bullet points from the email

# * Create a prompt to extract bullet points from Daniel's email ‚úâÔ∏è.

# In[8]:


prompt = f"""Extract bullet points from the following email. 
Include the sender information. 

Email:
{email}"""

print(prompt)


# * Run the ```get_llm_response``` function to get the response with bullet points.

# In[9]:


bullet_points = get_llm_response(prompt)
print(bullet_points)


# * Print the LLM response in Markdown format.

# In[10]:


# Print in Markdown format
display(Markdown(bullet_points))


# ## Extra practice
# 
# Try the exercises below to get an LLM to carry out different tasks using the email text you read in from file:
# 
# ### Exercise 1
# 
# Complete the code below to identify all the **countries** mentioned in the email.

# In[11]:


# Complete the code below to identify all of the countries mentioned 
# in the email
prompt = f"""Extract all countries name from the following email.

Email:
{email}
"""

countries = get_llm_response(prompt)
print(countries)


# ### Exercise 2
# 
# Write code below to list all of the activities that Daniel did on his trip. You'll need to create a prompt and use either `get_llm_response` or `print_llm_response`.

# In[13]:


# Write code below to list all of the activities that Daniel did on 
# his trip. You'll need to create a prompt and use either 
# get_llm_response or print_llm_response
# START YOUR CODE HERE
prompt = f"""List all activities that Daniel did on his trip from the following email.
Email:{email}"""
print(get_llm_response(prompt))
