# # Lesson 2 - Repeating tasks with for loops
from helper_functions import print_llm_response,get_llm_response

#from previous lesson:
list_of_tasks = [
    "Compose a brief email to my boss explaining that I will be late for tomorrow's meeting.",
    "Write a birthday poem for Otto, celebrating his 28th birthday.",
    "Write a 300-word review of the movie 'The Arrival'."
]
print(list_of_tasks)


# You passed them one by one to the LLM, repeatedly updated the task variable, then re-executed the function call with this code:
task = list_of_tasks[0]
print_llm_response(task)


# If you wanted to complete all the tasks in your list, you would have to re-write the same code multiple times. Alternatively, you can use a `for` loop.
# ## Iterating through task lists with AI
# When you run the cell below you will see how the for loop iterates through the elements in `list_of_tasks`.
for task in list_of_tasks:
    print(task)


# Here's the code that automatically passes all items in list to `print_llm_response`
for task in list_of_tasks:
    print_llm_response(task)


# Let's break this down.
# 
# The `for task in list` pattern works as follows:
# 
# - `task` is assigned the first item in the list. In this case, it's the string `"Compose a brief email to my boss explaining that I will be late for tomorrow's meeting."`
# - The next indented line is called a block and contains an action to carry out on `task`. In this example, the string gets passed to the LLM, and the result appears on the screen.
# - Then the loop starts again. Now, `task` is assigned the string "Write a birthday poem for Otto, celebrating his 28th birthday." It's the same variable, but with a different value.
# - `get_llm_response` runs again, and so on.
# 
# Be sure to call out the `:` at the end of the line. Indentation is crucial; if itâ€™s not correct, you'll get an error.

for task in list_of_tasks:
    print_llm_response(task)


# ## Iteratively updating AI prompts using lists
# You can even use lists with for loops to iteratively update more complex prompts with the list items. For instance, let's say that you have a list of ice-cream flavors:
#ice cream flavor example

ice_cream_flavors = [
    "Vanilla",
    "Chocolate",
    "Strawberry",
    "Mint Chocolate Chip"
]


# You can use a for loop to iterate through the flavors and create a captivating description for each of them.
for flavor in ice_cream_flavors:
    prompt = f"""For the ice creame flavor listed below,
    provide a captivating description that could be used for promotional purposes.
    
    Flavor: {flavor}
    """
    print(prompt)
    print_llm_response(prompt)


# Now that you know how to use lists, you can even save the promortional descriptions to another list using `.append()`:
#saving results to a list

promotional_descriptions = []
for flavor in ice_cream_flavors:
    prompt = f"""For the ice cream flavor listed below, 
    provide a captivating description that could be used for promotional purposes.

    Flavor: {flavor}

    """
    description = get_llm_response(prompt)
    promotional_descriptions.append(description)
    


# After you run that code, you should be able to access the promotional descriptions for each of your ice-cream flavors.
print(promotional_descriptions)


# ## Extra practice
ice_cream_flavors = ["Chocolate", "Mint Chocolate Chip"]
