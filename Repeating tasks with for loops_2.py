# # Lesson 2 - Repeating tasks with for loops

# This lesson will introduce you to a very important concept in programming: the `for` loop. A `for` loop is a special code pattern found in many languages that allows you to repeatedly perform actions on all the items in a list in an automated way. Let's take a look by starting with loading some functions.

# In[ ]:


from helper_functions import print_llm_response, get_llm_response


# ## From previous lesson
# 
# At the end of last lesson you saw this list of tasks

# In[ ]:


#from previous lesson:
list_of_tasks = [
    "Compose a brief email to my boss explaining that I will be late for tomorrow's meeting.",
    "Write a birthday poem for Otto, celebrating his 28th birthday.",
    "Write a 300-word review of the movie 'The Arrival'."
]
print(list_of_tasks)


# You passed them one by one to the LLM, repeatedly updated the task variable, then re-executed the function call with this code:

# In[ ]:


task = list_of_tasks[0]
print_llm_response(task)


# If you wanted to complete all the tasks in your list, you would have to re-write the same code multiple times. Alternatively, you can use a `for` loop.

# ## Iterating through task lists with AI

# When you run the cell below you will see how the for loop iterates through the elements in `list_of_tasks`.

# In[ ]:


for task in list_of_tasks:
    print(task)


# Here's the code that automatically passes all items in list to `print_llm_response`

# In[ ]:


for task in list_of_tasks:
    print_llm_response(task)


# Let's break this down.
# 
# The `for task in list` pattern works as follows:
# 
# - `task` is assigned the first item in the list. In this case, it's the string `"Compose a brief email to my boss explaining that I will be late for tomorrow's meeting."`
# - The next indented line is called a block and contains an action to carry out on `task`. In this example, the string gets passed to the LLM, and the result appears on the screen.
# - Then the loop starts again. Now, `task` is assigned the string "Write a birthday poem for Otto, celebrating his 28th birthday." It's the same variable, but with a different value.
# - `get_llm_response` runs again, and so on.
# 
# Be sure to call out the `:` at the end of the line. Indentation is crucial; if itâ€™s not correct, you'll get an error.

for task in list_of_tasks:
print_llm_response(task)

# ## Iteratively updating AI prompts using lists

# You can even use lists with for loops to iteratively update more complex prompts with the list items. For instance, let's say that you have a list of ice-cream flavors:

# In[ ]:


#ice cream flavor example
ice_cream_flavors = [
    "Vanilla",
    "Chocolate",
    "Strawberry",
    "Mint Chocolate Chip"
]


# You can use a for loop to iterate through the flavors and create a captivating description for each of them.

# In[ ]:


for flavor in ice_cream_flavors:
    prompt = f"""For the ice cream flavor listed below, 
    provide a captivating description that could be used for promotional purposes.

    Flavor: {flavor}

    """
    print_llm_response(prompt)


# Now that you know how to use lists, you can even save the promortional descriptions to another list using `.append()`:

# In[ ]:


#saving results to a list
promotional_descriptions = []
for flavor in ice_cream_flavors:
    prompt = f"""For the ice cream flavor listed below, 
    provide a captivating description that could be used for promotional purposes.

    Flavor: {flavor}

    """
    description = get_llm_response(prompt)
    promotional_descriptions.append(description)


# After you run that code, you should be able to access the promotional descriptions for each of your ice-cream flavors.

# In[ ]:


print(promotional_descriptions)


# ## Extra practice

# Please go through the exercises in the cells below if you want some extra practice for the topics you covered in this lesson.

# In[ ]:


# Fix the following code.
# It should print the flavors in
# ice_cream_flavors one by one.

ice_cream_flavors = ["Chocolate", "Mint Chocolate Chip"]

### EDIT THE FOLLOWING CODE ###
for flavor in ice_cream_flavors;
    print(ice_cream_flavors)
### --------------- ###


# In[ ]:


# Translate the flavors in ice_cream_flavors to Spanish
ice_cream_flavors = ["Vanilla", "Strawberry"]

for flavor in ice_cream_flavors:
    ### EDIT THE FOLLOWING CODE ###
    #Hint: you only need to add one or two sentences to the prompt
    prompt = f"""For the ice cream flavor listed below, 
    
    """
    ### --------------- ###
    print_llm_response(prompt)


# In[ ]:


# Write code to get a list with 
# words without typos

words_with_typos = ["Aple", "Wether", "Newpaper"]
words_without_typos = []

for word in words_with_typos:
    prompt = f"""Fix the spelling mistake in the following word: {word}
    Provide only the word.
    """
    correct_word = get_llm_response(prompt)
    ### WRITE CODE HERE  ###
    #Hint: Append the correct_word to the words_without_typos list 
    ### --------------- ###

print(words_without_typos)
