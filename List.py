# # Lesson 1 - Completing a task list with AI

# In this course, you'll learn how to automate tasks using Python. This means you'll be able to have Python **do repetitive things** and **make decisions** for you. One important skill you'll develop is the ability to store multiple pieces of data together. This lesson will introduce you to **lists**, a powerful tool for this purpose.
# 
# To get started, let's load some functions that you'll use in this lesson.

from helper_functions import print_llm_response, get_llm_response


# ### What are lists?
# In the last course, you learned about variables. Each variable holds a single piece of data.
# For example:
name = "Tommy"


# Let's say I want to write a poem for all my friends... all three of them. Run the cell below, then change the name above to Isabel and rerun the cell.

prompt = f"""
Write a four line birthday poem for my friend {name}. 
The poem should be inspired by the first letter of my friend's name.
"""
print_llm_response(prompt)


# Changing the value held by a variable requires lots of updates to the variables. A better way to handle this is by using a list. 
# 
# Lists are a data type in Python that can hold multiple pieces of data. This reduces the need for repetitive variable assignments since you can include all the pieces of data together.

# ## Creating  a list
# 
# Below, you will create a list that holds the names `"Tommy"`, `"Isabel"` and `"Daniel"`.
friends_list = ["Tommy", "Isabel", "Daniel"]
print(friends_list)


# `friends_list` is a single variable of type `list` that holds multiple values.
type(friends_list)


# You can check how many values are stored in the list by using `len()`:
len(friends_list)


# So this list has three elements.

# You can use lists as you used variables before within LLM prompts. Below, you are including the `friends_list` in the prompt to write four-line birthday poems for `'Tommy'`, `'Isabel'` and `'Daniel'`.
prompt = f"""
Write a set of four line birthday poems for my friends {friends_list}. 
The poems should be insipred by the first letter of each friend's name.
"""
print(prompt)


# Now, you can use that prompt with the LLM:
print_llm_response(prompt)


# ## Accessing individual elements of a list

# You can access individual elements from a list. Let's ask the chatbot how to do that.

# For instance, to access the first element, you would use the following code:
first_friend = friends_list[0]
print(first_friend)  # Output: Tommy


# To access the second element, you would use the following code:
print(friends_list[1]) # Output: Isabel


# Note that for accessing the first element you used the index 0, and for accessing the second element you used 1.

# So, if you do the following, you'll get an error.
print(friends_list[3]) # Gives an error


# But, if you run the following code, you will be able to access the last element from that list. 
print(friends_list[2])


# ## Adding another element to the list
print(friends_list)


# If you want to add some data to an list, you will use `list.append(new_data)`. So, to add `"Otto"` to your `friends_list`, you can run the following code:
# add single element to list
friends_list.append("Otto")
print(friends_list)


# Try for yourself - modify code to add another friend, or yourself
# Modify the code below to add another friend:
friends_list.append("Suresh")


# ## Deleting elements

# Tommy moved to Bora Bora, so we can't be friends anymore. Let's remove Tommy from `friends_list` by using `.remove()`:
#using remove
friends_list.remove("Tommy")
print(friends_list)


# ## Lists with other data types
# 
# Lists can hold any type of data. For instance, here is a list of numbers
list_ages = [42, 28, 30]
print(list_ages)


# Lists can also hold long strings. Here's a list of tasks that might make up a todo list
#list of tasks in priority order. Multi-line lists are allowed in python!
list_of_tasks = [
    "Compose a brief email to my boss explaining that I will be late for tomorrow's meeting.",
    "Write a birthday poem for Otto, celebrating his 28th birthday.",
    "Write a 300-word review of the movie 'The Arrival'."
]


# If you were wondering how to use lists with AI, take this example. Each element in the previous list is a string that you can pass to `print_llm_response()`. If you want an LLM to do each of these tasks for you, here's what you would do:
# 
# Set a variable called `task` to each element in the list in turn, then pass it to `print_llm_response()`.
task = list_of_tasks[0]
print_llm_response(task)

task = list_of_tasks[1]
print_llm_response(task)

task = list_of_tasks[2]
print_llm_response(task)


# You worked through all the elements in the list, but there is still a lot of repetition here. You had to specify each element separately. There is actually a much better way to do this using something called a for loop. Let's go to the next video to see it in action.

# ## Extra practice

# Please go through the exercises in the cells below if you want some extra practice for the topics you covered in this lesson.

# Create a list with the titles 
# of five of your favorite movies
